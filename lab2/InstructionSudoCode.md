### BEQ OPcode = 1100011, Func3 = 000
Branch if $rs1 == rs2$ PC = label

#### Order of Operations

1) Read the PC
2) Get the instruction from the Instruction Memory
3) Decode the instruction using the control unit
4) The Main Control unit gets the following signals: ImmSrc = 2, RegWrite = 0, MemWrite = 0, PCSrc = 0,1
5) The ALU Control unit gets the following signals: ALUSrc = 0, ALUControl = 001
6) The ImmExtender carries through using the ImmSrc control signal
7) The PCTarget module creates the new PC value from this Extended Immediate value
8) The two source registers are compared (Rs1 -> SrcA - Rs2 -> SrcB)
9) The ALUSrc Signal = 0 to to signal to the ALU to use SrcB not ImmExtended
10) If the value is 0 a ALUzero Flag = 1 to signal to the PSSrc = 1
11) If the PSSrc = 1 use PCTarget address
12) If not use the next PC+4 address
#### Modules in use

##### ImmSrc = 2
The branch offset is 13 bits stored in a 12 bit imm field this is handled by the Extender module and the ImmSrc controls how the mudule interprets the incominhg data.

##### ALUControl = 001
The ALU will perform a subtraction
Somehow we must determine that the value of this subtraction is 0

##### if SrcA - SrcB = 0 PCSrc = 1
set the PC control signal to 1 to branch to the new address provided by the instruction immediate. Use the **PCTarget module**

##### if SrcA - SrcB = !0 PCSrc = 0
Use the **PC+4 module** to move forward in the instructions

##### ALUSrc = 0
chooses SrcB from the mem file instead of the extended immediate in other cases

No writing to registers

##### MemWrite = 0
No writing to memory
